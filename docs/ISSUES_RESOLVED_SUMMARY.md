# Amarktai Network - Issues Resolved Summary

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

## Issue 1: Overview Image Sizing ✅ FIXED

### Problem
The overview image in the Dashboard was too small and didn't fill the block properly, making the section look awkward.

### Root Cause
- CSS used `flex: 0 0 50%` which prevented the image from expanding
- Container had `height: calc(100% - 40px)` with `overflow: hidden` which cut off content
- `min-height: 400px` was too small for the intended visual impact

### Solution Applied
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/DashboardV3.css`

**Changes:**
1. Container: Changed to `min-height: 500px; height: auto` for natural expansion
2. Image: Changed to `flex: 1; min-width: 50%; min-height: 500px` for proper filling
3. Metrics: Changed to `flex: 1; min-width: 50%; min-height: 500px` for balance

**Result:**
- ✅ Image now properly fills the entire block
- ✅ Both image and metrics have equal, balanced presence
- ✅ Professional, polished appearance
- ✅ 100px taller (500px vs 400px) for better visual impact

### Visual Comparison
